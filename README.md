Problem Set 0.  

Anti-Bike Man ver 1.1

Press the space bar to see the title sequence and begin the game.  Press the 'b' button when the traffic light is red, and the bike is moving
to be successful in the game.

I could not figure out how to have one button press equal only one input, any guidance in those regards would be appreciated!
